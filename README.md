DOTS based Tetris clone

This project is part of the tutorial series "Let's build a DOTS based Tetris Clone", published on YouTube by April Games.

This is a learning project, intended to show you how to solve real life problems. At the moment of uploading this project, the DOTS project is still in preview, so there are areas in which we simply can't be sure what are the best practices, as there may be changes in the technology before the final release. 

You can find an explanation of the code and the project in general by watching the video series: This is the first episode: https://youtu.be/yD4WKyG1Zf8

# Update
Originally it was planed to update this repository with every new episode, but due to events outside of my control, I won't be able to produce more videos. So the finall version was uploaded without any further video explanation, but you can clone the projects and study the code yourself.
